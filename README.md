The method combines the principle of autoencoder with a Runge-Kutta scheme to learn low-dimensional quadratic embeddings for high-fidelity complex dynamic data.

The important steps of the methodology are:

1. Collect measurement data  
2. Define encoder, decoder, and a quadratic models with user-defined embedding dimensions
3. Train the networks simultaneously using the loss function
 	
We utilize automatic differentiation implemented in PyTorch. 

## Contains
* `Functions` contains externalized Python routines, e.g., training and loading data
* `Examples` contains all the examples presented in the paper [1]. 

## Reproducibility 
To reproduce all the results in the paper [1], please run `Example_Burgers2D.py ` and `Example_Tubular.py` in the folder `Examples`. One may run the corresponding jupyter notebooks as well. All the results will be saved in the folder `.\Examples\logs\`.

## Dependencies
For reproducibility, we have stored all dependencies and their versions in `environment.yml`. A virtual environment, namely `Quad_embeds` can be created using `conda`:
 
 ```
 conda env create -f environment.yml
 conda activate Quad_embeds
 ```
